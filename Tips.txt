While trying to push code files from a local repo to a Github repo,keep in mind:
1. The two repos should not already have files with commits done on both ends. This way Git won't 
   recognise the file pattern and would throw an error while pushing/pulling.
2. Ideally, the local repo should not be made first. We should first create a Github repo and upload 
   the code files to the Github repo.Then clone this repo to as a local repo on PC and pull its contents.
   Now Git will be aware of the pattern of files since we have uploaded files at Gihub and cloned the same
   files on our local system. Now we can create/add files to our local repo and push them comfortably to
   Github without issues.
